**OVERVIEW**
A digitized test from the study, Chen, P., & Toglia, J. (2022). The 3s Spreadsheet Test version 2 for assessing egocentric viewer-centered and allocentric stimulus-centered spatial neglect. Applied Neuropsychology: Adult, 29(6), 1369-1379. https://doi.org/10.1080/23279095.2021.1878462.

**OBJECTIVE**
This digitized form of the test allows those with Node access to take and submit the test to a blockchain of all test results. The amalgamation of test results from different user's contribute to the programs ability to provide INSIGHT on a persons spacial and cognitive impairment that are originally based on the baselines provided from the study. The K-Means algorithm for determining whether or not any given test score is considered to represent a spacial ailment of the examinee will IMPROVE as more tests are added to the blockchain as to distribute the test results into one of the two bimodal sets of either (cognitive impairment, or healthy).

**DATA PRIVACY**
All data stored on blockchain and communicated over HTTPS is secure. Proper deployment with SSL certificates help for E2E communication, blockchain storage is secure as all patient testing info is homomorphically encrypted to allow for continuous model training whilst maintaining it's human-unreadability before it is placed into the blockchain.
